[//]: # (TODO: Update with latest prod details, elaborate on API descriptions)
# Changelog

## August 31, 2026

**API updates**

* **Launch of v4 Generative Expand and Fill**: `POST /v4/images/expand` and `POST /v4/images/fill` are now available.
  * [Expand Image API](../../api/index.md)
  * [Fill Image API](../../api/index.md)

> **Note:** Unlike the v3 equivalents, these v4 endpoints do **not** have an `-async` suffix -- `POST /v4/images/expand-async` and `POST /v4/images/fill-async` are not valid routes and return `404`. `POST /v4/images/expand` and `POST /v4/images/fill` are the only v4 paths for these operations, and both are always asynchronous (submit, then poll for the result).
>
> To check job status or retrieve the result, always call the URL returned in the submit response's `links.result.url` (or `.href`) field -- see [`GET /jobs/result/{jobId}`](../../api/index.md). The submit response redirects polling to a per-organization gateway host (e.g. `https://firefly-epo<org-id>.adobe.io/...`), which differs from both the host you submitted the job to and the `statusUrl` field. `statusUrl` is informational only and should not be polled directly.

### Upscale API: Beta to GA (Breaking Change)

During the beta period, the `/v3/images/upscale` endpoint was named and documented as the "creative upsampler"; however the underlying model being called was always the **precise upsampler**. This GA release corrects that naming inconsistency. The service behavior is unchanged; only the names are being aligned to reflect reality.

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

#### 1. `creative_upsampler_v1` header value rejected

Passing `creative_upsampler_v1` in the `x-model-version` header now returns a **422 Unprocessable Entity**:

```json
{
  "error_code": "validation_error",
  "message": "Invalid x-model-version: creative_upsampler_v1. Only 'precise_upsampler_v1' is supported."
}
```

**Action required:** Update or remove the `x-model-version` header. The new default is `precise_upsampler_v1`.

```http
x-model-version: precise_upsampler_v1
```

#### 2. Schema and operation identifiers renamed

All `Creative*` upsampler identifiers have been renamed to `Precise*` to reflect the correct underlying model. If you are using a generated SDK or referencing schema `$ref` values directly, update accordingly.

| Old name (beta) | New name (GA) |
| --- | --- |
| `creativeUpsamplerV3Async` | `preciseUpsamplerV3Async` |
| `CreativeUpsamplerRequestV3` | `PreciseUpsamplerRequestV3` |
| `CreativeUpscaleAcceptResponseV3` | `PreciseUpscaleAcceptResponseV3` |
| `CreativeUpscaleTaskLink` | `PreciseUpscaleTaskLink` |
| `CreativeUpsamplerResponse` | `PreciseUpsamplerResponse` |

> **Note:** The request body shape and response structure are **unchanged**. This is a rename only; no fields have been added, removed, or modified.

### Summary of all spec changes

| Area | Before (beta) | After (GA) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `x-model-version` accepted values | `creative_upsampler_v1` | `precise_upsampler_v1` |
| `x-model-version` default | `creative_upsampler_v1` | `precise_upsampler_v1` |
| Invalid model version response | Undefined behaviour | `422` with `validation_error` |
| `operationId` | `creativeUpsamplerV3Async` | `preciseUpsamplerV3Async` |
| Request schema | `CreativeUpsamplerRequestV3` | `PreciseUpsamplerRequestV3` |
| Accept response schema | `CreativeUpscaleAcceptResponseV3` | `PreciseUpscaleAcceptResponseV3` |
| Task link schema | `CreativeUpscaleTaskLink` | `PreciseUpscaleTaskLink` |
| Result schema | `CreativeUpsamplerResponse` | `PreciseUpsamplerResponse` |
| Endpoint summary | `Upscale image (beta)` | `Upscale image` |
| `Upscale` tag description | `...creative upsampler (beta)` | `...precise upsampler` |

### Deprecation timeline

| Date | Event |
| --- | --- |
| Prior to 2026-04-24 | Beta: `creative_upsampler_v1` available; underlying model was always the precise upsampler |
| **2026-04-24** | **GA: `creative_upsampler_v1` removed; `precise_upsampler_v1` is the only supported value; all schema identifiers corrected** |
